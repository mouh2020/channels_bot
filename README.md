# Channels Bot
A bot that transfers a message to a list of channels.

**Notes:**

*  The bot must be added as an admin to the channel.
*  When you add the channel id remove (-) from the channel id (example : 1965823218 not -1965823218).
*  Don't remove the file named (channels.db). It's your channels database.
